## Usage

[See here for information on using this definition with an existing project](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started/open).

If you prefer, you can also just look through the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder to understand how to make changes to your own project.

If you want to try out the test project instead, run **Remote-Container: Open Folder in Container...** in VS Code and select a cloned copy of the entire folder. 

Then, open test-project/hello.py and press shift-enter to run the cell and see the interactive matplotlib output.
