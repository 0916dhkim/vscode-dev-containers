## Summary

*A basic dev container definition for developing Python 3 applications in an Anaconda container. Installs dependencies from your environment.yml file and the Python extension.*

| Metadata | Value |  
|----------|-------|
| *Contributors* | The VS Code Team |
| *Definition type* | Dockerfile |
| *Languages, platforms* | Python |

## Usage

[See here for information on using this definition with an existing project](../../README.md#using-a-definition).

If you prefer, you can also just look through the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder to understand how to make changes to your own project.

If you want to try out the test project instead, run **Remote-Container: Open Folder in Container...** in VS Code and select a cloned copy of the entire folder. 

Then, open test-project/hello.py and press shift-enter to run the cell and see the interactive matplotlib output.
