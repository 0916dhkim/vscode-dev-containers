# Azure HDInsight w/Python 3

## Summary

*A basic dev container definition for using Azure HDInsight in a container. Includes everything you need to get up and running.*

| Metadata | Value |  
|----------|-------|
| *Contributors* | The VS Code Team |
| *Definition type* | Dockerfile |
| *Languages, platforms* | Azure HDInsight, Python |

## Usage

First, install the **[Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension)** extension pack if you have not already.

To use the definition with your own project:

1. Copy the `.devcontainer` folder into your project root.
2. Reopen the folder in the container (e.g. using the **Remote-Container: Reopen Folder in Container** command in VS Code) to use it unmodified.

If you prefer, you can look through the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder to understand how to make changes to your own project.
