| Metadata | Value |  
|----------|-------|
| *Contributors* | The VS Code Team |
| *Definition type* | Dockerfile |
| *Languages, platforms* | Markdown |

## Usage

First, install the **[Visual Studio Code Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension)** extension pack if you have not already.

To use the definition with your own project:

1. Copy the `.devcontainer` folder into your project root.
2. Reopen the folder in the container (e.g. using the **Remote-Container: Reopen Folder in Container** command in VS Code) to use it unmodified.

If you prefer, you can look through the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder to understand how to make changes to your own project.

If you want to try out the test project instead, run **Remote-Container: Open Folder in Container...** in VS Code and select a cloned copy of the entire folder. You can then start the test program from Debug panel in VS Code.
