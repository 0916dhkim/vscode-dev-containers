## Usage

[See here for information on using this definition with an existing project](../../README.md#using-a-definition).

If you prefer, you can also just look through the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder to understand how to make changes to your own project.

If you want to try out the test project instead, run **Remote-Container: Open Folder in Container...** in VS Code and select a cloned copy of the entire folder. You can then start the test program from Debug panel in VS Code.
